Execute and share nodeJS code on the browser!

### Install

You need to install node in your machine (I recommend doing it through nvm).

Once done, install the project dependencies

$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
```

### Run

Once all installed, type

```
$ grunt
```

And the web app will be hosted at http://localhost:9001/app/#/home
